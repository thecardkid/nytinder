		"lead_paragraph": "DES MOINES -- A few days before the Iowa caucuses, Newt Gingrich's campaign headquarters just outside the city is a spectacle of pre-computer-age disorder, with volunteers rushing voter updates across the room on yellow Post-it notes. At the offices of Mitt Romney, who has built a ground organization aimed at matching the intensity of his television advertising barrage, aides are methodically analyzing data on each voter to create the perfect pitch: those worried about illegal immigration, for example, are invited to join a conference call with a border county sheriff in Arizona.",
		"abstract": "Hundreds of campaign staff members, aides and volunteers are waging an unglamorous ground war that will largely determine the outcome of the Republican presidential caucuses in Iowa; in the closing hours before the caucuses, the tedious and time-consuming work of identifying voters and persuading them to show up at the caucuses could make the difference among Republican who cannot seem to make up their minds.
